        Surfing is a water sport where athletes ride 
        waves on surfboards, using balance and skill to glide across the 
        oceans surface. Originating in Polynesia and popularized 
        in Hawaii, it has become a global pastime and lifestyle symbolizing 
        freedom and connection to nature. Surfers rely on reading wave patterns, 
        timing, and physical endurance, making it both an art and a sport.
