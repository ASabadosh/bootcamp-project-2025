            Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between 
            two teams, where players score runs by hitting a pitched ball and 
            running around bases. Originating in the United States in the 19th century, 
            its known as “Americas pastime” and has spread worldwide. 
            The game combines strategy, precision, 
            and teamwork, making it both highly competitive and deeply rooted in tradition.
